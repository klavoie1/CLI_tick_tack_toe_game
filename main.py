# This is a Command Line Project, that aims to be a two player
# Tick-Tack-Toe Game. The first person to go will select either
# X or O and make a selection based on a common game grid.
# The next player will then be allowed to place their position on the 
# grid. This will continue until either someone gets three in a row
# or the game ends in a tie.
